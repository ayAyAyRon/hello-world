Hello!
Sexy ;)

Welcome to my git repo!
I'm still learning a lot. Like that git still inexplicably uses the overly confusing vim command-line editor if you forget to include a message in your commit. To be fair however, learning vim just boosted my nerd status by 42,000%.
One more commit: "Branch early, branch often"

Edits on gitHub are also kosher...
...just as edits done locally can be simply pushed up.
